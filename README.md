### 🔷 PlaqueMS (Private Repository)
*A secure web platform for multi-cohort atherosclerosis omics analysis (MSc Thesis Project)*  
- Designed and implemented using Django, MySQL, and Neo4j.  
- Integrated multi-modal proteomics and clinical metadata from human atherosclerotic plaques across three independent cohorts.
- Supports phenotype-driven exploration, protein network visualisation (Cytoscape), and embedded ML models (SVM, Random Forest, Elastic Net Regression) optimised via a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm.

> **Note:** This repository is currently private due to inclusion of data from an unpublished study and will be made public following its publication (expected in 6–12 months).

**The full MSc thesis report is publicly available for review.**
